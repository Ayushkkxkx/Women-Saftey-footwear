# Women-Saftey-footwear
About the Project:
•	The project is based on safety of women from physical (or) sexual harassment. 
•	The idea is to design a footwear for the women which is embedded with electric shock producers and GPS Tracking System.
•	The Footwear which we are designing is going to be the same as the daily wear (which are being used nowadays) with embedded equipment’s.

Project Description:
•	Basically, the everyone wears some kind of footwear whenever they go out for some work. So, we have decided to provide safety using these footwears.  
•	When a woman is being “ATTACKED”, she needs to protect herself or escape from that place.
•	So, when she is being attacked, using her Footwear she needs to hit (or) tap the attacker, as the footwear are embedded with shock providers, the attacker becomes unconscious due the shock produced.
•	Meanwhile, if the shock providers are activated more than 1 time, then immediately the GPS tracker is going to get activated and sends the location of that women to the nearby police stations (while the attacker is unconscious) and to some of the selected contacts in her mobile.
•	When the location is sent to the nearby Police Station, an alarm rings in the there and the guards will reach to that location to save that woman.

REQUIREMENTS:
Shoes.
GPS Tracking system small sized.
A small electric shocking system embedded in shoes.
Integration of systems in police stations to operate.

Some Questions?
•	What if the Women start using it for a bad purpose like using it every time when there is no need?

Ans) As we said if the shock providers get activated for at least 1 time, the police guards are going to arrive at the location where the woman is located.
IF they come to that no harm has happened, they will  collect a fine of Rs.5000. (This fine depends )
